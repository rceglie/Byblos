What's in a LFM?

Needed:

- What fight
    UWU, UCOB, TEA, DSU
- Times
    Select from intervals of 15 min - no way groups start at anything else
- Prog point
    Would need to manually add options for each fight
- Roles needed
    Allow for flex/multiple role searching?
- Current comp

Optional/Possible:

- ilvl/gear
- Current member logs
    Just a link to the log, nothing fancy
- Past experience
    Not sure here, maybe single/double/triple legend options, should they be able to select certain fights? ex) need TEA/UCOB
    clear.
- Free space for info
    Here they can put whatever crap about "we've been raiding for 25 years" etc.

Features when we have a 10 man team:

- Verify logs/clears???? Might not be as popular and would be a bit tough, but would be really cool
- Connect avg parsing numbers to account? Same problems as above
