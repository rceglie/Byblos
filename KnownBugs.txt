When selecting roles needed for the static, if a job is selected, then the ANY for that role is selected and unselected, the job initially selected
will still appear to be selected, but will not actually be selected in the code.
EX) PLD selected, Tank (ANY) select, Tank (ANY) deselected : PLD will still appear to be selected but will not show up after "Confirm Roles" is pressed
