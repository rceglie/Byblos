When selecting roles needed for the static, if a job is selected, then the ANY for that role is selected and unselected, the job initially selected
will still appear to be selected, but will not actually be selected in the code.
EX) PLD selected, Tank (ANY) select, Tank (ANY) deselected : PLD will still appear to be selected but will not show up after "Confirm Roles" is pressed

When selecting a time for create post, the times will save even if the user doesnt hit confirm times. However, the actual postData state does not update with the unsaved times.




Not a bug:
When adding new prog point, change options dropdown (obviouisly) and change Components/ShowPosts/config.js
